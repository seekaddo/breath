The initial version of this generator was a shell script using
the od utility to extract 128 bits (16 octets) from /dev/random
and output them in hex format.  [gps improve wording/tech
aspect]

That gave, of course, 32 characters.

My friend James Kanze brought up the idea to represent each byte
in base 62, using as digits all the alphanumeric characters
allowed in a C or C++ identifier, except underscore: 0-9, a-f,
A-F. [footnote1]

This allows using 3 base-62 digits for each couple of bytes,
thus reducing the number of characters to 24.

I played with various implementations of this idea, using
different combinations of the Unix tools. [list them? --gps]

At a point however it occurred to me that we could just generate
random numbers in 0..61 and represent each of them with one of
the alphanumeric characters above.

And I played with several implementations of this different
idea. The main drawback was that no scripted implementations
seemed reasonably fast on Cygwin (at least at the time).
So I went with C++.

This is, historically, the reason for the "24" as number of
generated random characters (later changed to more characters).

James went for a different approach (which I happened to
suggest, although I wasn't at all sure it would work until James
explained it back to me:-)), using the tr utility, which
introduces a little bias. It's simpler, and the bias is
acceptable, but of course C++ offers a lot more versatility, and
the short development time which is spent on it is greatly
repaid.

[footnote1] Using underscore, too, would require more maneuvering
            to avoid the appearance of consecutive underscores and
            other reserved combinations.
