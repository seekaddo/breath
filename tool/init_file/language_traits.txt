#
#       Language traits:
#       ================
#
#       This is just a table that lists some aspects, such as comment
#       delimiters and similar, which we use from the relevant scripts
#       to inizialize the content of newly created files.
#
#       The important thing is that it allows adding support for new
#       types of files without changing the script themselves.
#
#       Any line beginning with '#' in this file is treated as a
#       comment (not because this file is written in any particular
#       language: just because, conventionally, we chose to do so, and
#       filter out any such lines).
#
#       We also added an entry for .txt files. An abuse, but handy.
#       Given the above, it seemed natural to choose '#' for
#       "comments" in .txt files.
#
#       NOTE:
#       * since, of course, we don't want to retrofit all existing
#         files, changes to the table should be limited to *addition*
#         of new entries, barring modifications which might be
#         absolutely necessary.
#
#       NOTE 2:
#       * keep in sync with $BREATH_ROOT/.gitattributes

#   Note:
#       The css mode for Emacs seems to have been introduced starting
#       from version 22.1 (!) What happens for unrecognized modes?
