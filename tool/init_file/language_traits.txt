#
#       Language traits:
#       ================
#
#       This is just a table that lists some aspects, such as comment
#       delimiters and similar, which we use from the relevant scripts
#       to inizialize the content of newly created files.
#
#       The important thing is that it allows adding support for new
#       types of files without changing the script themselves.
#
#       Any line beginning with '#' in this file is treated as a comment
#       (not because this file is written in any particular language:
#       just because, conventionally, we chose to do so, and filter out
#       any such lines).
#
#       We also added an entry for .txt files. An abuse, but handy.
#       Given the above, it seemed natural to choose '#' for "comments"
#       in .txt files.
#
#       NOTE:
#           since, of course, we don't want to retrofit all existing
#           files, changes to the table should be limited to *addition*
#           of new entries, barring modifications which might be
#           absolutely necessary.
#
#       NOTE 2:
#
#           keep the following files in sync:
#
#            - .editorconfig
#            - .gitattributes
#            - language_traits.txt
#            - make_file_trailer.sh

#       Note:
#           The css mode for Emacs seems to have been introduced
#           starting from version 22.1 (!) What happens for unrecognized
#           modes?
