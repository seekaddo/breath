"       Maintainance:
"           keep in sync with the corresponding Emacs facilities
" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

"       Rationale:
"       ----------
"
"       For some file types we set Unix line endings, even under
"       Windows, which makes Cygwin and other toolsets work smoothly in
"       their most common (recommended) configuration. We don't do so
"       directly in response to BufNewFile because at that time the
"       modelines we have inserted haven't been applied yet (it may just
"       seem that they are, sometimes, because of the file name
"       extension used :-)) and I couldn't find a function akin to
"       Emacs' hack-local-variables(). We use BufWinEnter, instead,
"       taking care to not modify anything if it isn't the first enter
"       on a buffer we have filled ourselves (so if, for instance, the
"       user sets ff to the Windows style we don't revert it: he/she
"       must have had a good reason to do so).
"
"       Note, too, the usage of an explicit 'sh -c' to invoke our
"       script: Vim uses the value of the 'shell' option as name of the
"       shell (command language interpreter) to use for ! and :!
"       commands, and that is an important setting we don't want to
"       interfere with. An idea would be to set it to 'sh' and restore
"       it when we are done, but I couldn't find any synchronization
"       mechanism in the Vim docs (nor a guarantee that it would work
"       without locking). So, we simply use whatever shell is configured
"       in the editor to launch our 'sh'; for this we rely on 'sh' to be
"       on the PATH (which must be set anyway, even under Windows, to
"       have sed, awk and the other utilities work).
