This file collects some wisdom I accumulated while working on Breath :-) The
purpose is to list things I didn't find in any book or article. If you find
similar (or contrary) advice elsewhere, please send me a mail to let me know:
I'll be glad to compare my findings with those of the author.


- Don't be afraid of writing a wrong rationale

  That doesn't mean writing that the reason for doing something was Y, when it
  was X, instead. Don't do that :-) It means writing that it was X even if you
  are not sure that X is a good reason. Your future self, or anyone else, might
  know enough to "see" that your reason was not good, and can thus change the
  code confidently, instead of wondering whether there was any valid reason it
  was written that way. IOWs: a "wrong" rationale is better than no rationale.
