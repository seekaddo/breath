#       Maintenance note
#       ----------------
#
#       Be sure that modifications to these options don't put the various
#       compiler-specific makefiles out of sync (e.g. by requiring
#       C++14 with one compiler and C++17 with another).
#
#
#       As usual, the options are listed in two groups. The group
#       appearing first relates mainly to standards conformance. The
#       other group contains other options in alphabetical order.
#
#       Special notes for some of the options:
#       ======================================
#
#       (See gcc.mk for further notes on some options.)
#
#       -Wno-weak-vtables:
#
#           The -Wweak-vtables warning tries to point out possible
#           object files bloat, but that's probably moot either because
#           it isn't really going to make a difference on performances,
#           and because the linker will likely collapse the duplicated
#           vtables anyway.
#
#           So this warning can be safely suppressed. Note, too, that
#           it would be difficult to silence it by modifying the code,
#           as in the case (as of Febrary 27, 2009) for the class
#           command_line_error, in command_line.hpp.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# KEEP in sync! (See above.)
