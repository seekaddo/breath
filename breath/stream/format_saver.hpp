//      format_saver:
//      =============
//
//!     RAII-based "guard" (saver/restorer) of a stream object's
//!     formatting info.
//!
//!     An instance of this template class saves the formatting state
//!     of a stream object in its constructor and restores it in its
//!     destructor.
//!
//!     Note: do not confuse what we call here the "formatting info"
//!     or "formatting state" (the set of all info which affect
//!     formatting), with the "state" of a stream object, which
//!     reflects the integrity of its stream buffer and is of no
//!     concern to this class.
//!
//!
//!     This facility restores everything except:
//!
//!     - integrity state ( \c rdstate() )
//!         since it represents errors; restoring would be a non-sense
//!
//!     - pointer to stream buffer ( \c rdbuf() )
//!     - stream and stream buffer locale
//!     - exception mask
//!     - synchronized output stream ( \c tie() )
//!
//!
//!     Rationale:
//!     ----------
//!
//!     We chose to have a single class to save all the relevant
//!     format information, rather than one class for each attribute
//!     (as, for instance, some Boost facilities do) for two reasons:
//!
//!     - the resulting code is significantly shorter and simpler,
//!       with obvious benefits on maintenance
//!
//!     - maintenance of client code is simplified too: if a function
//!       modifies more formatting flags than it initially did, the
//!       maintainer need not remember to correspondingly add more
//!       format savers (or use a new, more comprehensive, format
//!       saver type)
//!
//!     About locales:
//!
//!     Instances of the class \c ios_base contain a locale object.
//!     Instances of \c basic_ios (which have an \c ios_base
//!     subobject) hold a pointer the stream buffer, which has a
//!     locale too (coding conversions).
//!
//!     \c basic_ios::copyfmt copies the stream locale (member of
//!     \c ios_base), but not the stream-buffer one. Note, BTW, that
//!     it does so without triggering the \c imbue_event.
//!
//!     I meditated at length what to do about locales, because they
//!     also deal with non formatting-related stuff, such as ctype:
//!     actually, we should restore only the facets which affect
//!     formatting. In the end, there wasn't enough experience with
//!     the problem so the choice, at least for now, is to not restore
//!     any locale.
//!
//!     Credits:
//!     --------
//!
//!     This template was born as a further elaboration of a class by
//!     James Kanze, named \c IOSave. And it was a comment in his code
//!     to suggest using copyfmt, in order to save the additional
//!     stream info. James also gave, as usual, excellent feedback on
//!     various design issues, in particular about locales and imbue.
