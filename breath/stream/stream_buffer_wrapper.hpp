//      stream_buffer_wrapper:
//      ======================
//
//!     This template is meant to be used to wrap a \c basic_streambuf
//!     when defining a new stream type. In this case, we'd want to have
//!     a stream buffer data member in the derived class, but that would
//!     mean passing its address to the stream base class(es) \e before
//!     its construction (because base subobjects are constructed before
//!     data members).
//!
//!     That's undefined behavior.
//!
//!     Using derivation solves this problem, as long as we can
//!     guarantee that the stream buffer is constructed before the
//!     streams. But it introduces another one: we'd need to pass the \c
//!     this pointer, in the constructor initialization list, to the
//!     base stream constructor(s). Which is probably undefined
//!     behavior, as well.
//!
//!     A solution is to use this wrapper, which allows getting the
//!     contained buffer address without using \c this.
//!
//!     Note that this might become a generic wrapper, but we mean to
//!     only use it for stream buffers, hence its specific name.
//!
//!     An alternative technique to define a stream type would be to \e
//!     default-construct the stream base(s) and have a normal stream
//!     buffer data member; then calling \c std::ios_base::init() with
//!     the address of the buffer from the body of the derived
//!     constructor.
//!
//!     This may lead to multiple calls to \c init(). Which is probably
//!     meant to work, but the standard doesn't make this crystal clear.
//!     So we avoid it, and use this wrapper, instead. (If the standard
//!     was clearer in this regard, I'd prefer this solution.)
