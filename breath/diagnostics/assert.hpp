//      BREATH_ASSERT:
//      --------------
//
//!     \hideinitializer
//!
//!     BREATH_ASSERT() is the simplest runtime assertion facility in the Breath
//!     collection. Differently from the standard \c assert() it is always
//!     defined and has always the same expansion (regardless of \c NDEBUG).
//!
//!     The code
//!
//!         BREATH_ASSERT( expr )
//!
//!     expands to an expression. When that expression is evaluated:
//!     first, if \c expr is not implicitly convertible to
//!     bool the program is ill-formed; otherwise, an assertion is
//!     triggered \e iif the result of such a conversion is \c false.
//!     If the result is true, the evaluation has no effect.
//!
//!     In this context, "triggering an assertion" means writing
//!     information related to the specific macro invocation (e.g.
//!     line number and source file name) to \c std::cerr, then
//!     calling \c std::abort().
//!
//!     Rationale
//!     ---------
//!
//!     It has become "common practice" to define the macro \c NDEBUG
//!     when compiling the "release" version of code. Many IDEs do so
//!     silently. In fact, "NDEBUG" (or a logical complement of it, such as
//!     \c _DEBUG) has become the macro which is usually checked for, via #if,
//!     by your library code to know which version of it (release/debug) you want
//!     to link with. We believe, though, that assertions must be left on in
//!     the release version of the product. So we wanted an assert macro
//!     decoupled from \c NDEBUG. (Thinking of it, there has been a fatal
//!     misunderstanding: the C committee thought of a macro to enable/disable
//!     assertions, but alas named it "NDEBUG", which suggests "no debug". And
//!     that's the meaning everyone seems to have assigned to it. Had they
//!     called it e.g. "NASSERT" all this wouldn't probably have happened.)
